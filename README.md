# d4c-course-scraping

## About
A python tool to scrape course catalogs of educational institutions. Created for Ryan Mitchell's Spring 2017 seminar at Olin College.

## Status
In progress, not usable yet.

The scrapers are currently generic template copies of Ryan's scripts; we are currently working through the list of all 4-year undergraduate engineering programs in Massachusetts (from the ABET website) and seeing which ones yield which kinds of data. It is likely that we will only scrape a subset of these sites for comparision. As scripts become customized to scrape specific schools, this code will be edited and this README updated.
